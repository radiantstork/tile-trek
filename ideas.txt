1. IDEAS
enum for DIRECTION (TOP BOTTOM LEFT RIGHT)
class Player
class GameController (keyboard input, game state - start/reset/win)
class GameView (loads UI elements - buttons, layout)
class SurpriseBox (the question mark)


background music
timer
win conditions?
DEBUFFS (question mark icon that can be picked up): vignette, walls become invisible/flashing, inverted movement,
        end gets moved, player gets tped.


2. CONVENTIONS
- all local variable declarations are put at the beginning of their scope
- "static" comes before "final"
- the access modifier (if used) is always the first modifier for a class/method/field declaration
- any source file ends with a new line
- explicit naming to avoid overuse of comments
- the main method is placed before the first constructor
